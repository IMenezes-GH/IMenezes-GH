### OlÃ¡! I'm Isabela, a student from Brazil.

Currently graduating in Data Science and looking to get into web-development  

I'm passionate about many things, such as birds, retro videogames and digital art and FOSS software.
I love learning new things and helping people however I can whenever possible ðŸ’™

*Still trying to figure things out and looking forward to contributing to the open source community one day!*
